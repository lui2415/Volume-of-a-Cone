# Volume-of-a-Cone
I'm creating another program to calculate the volume of a cone 

# we will need to consider 2 lines of code 
    # r = the radius of the cone
    # h = the height of the cone
# and we will need to set as minimum value that they can get is 1 and maximum value will be 100
# now lets pretend that we want to evaluate the next formula (pi * r^2 * h)/3
# for mathematical uses we cannot use strings and the type of data that we get from the function input()
    #it returns only strings type data so we use the "int()" function to convert those values to integers

#Funtions
# int() = converts strings to integers, but only string characters that can represent an integer otherwise displays an eror
# str() = converts integers to strings, but with the same conditions that the int() function
